# Exercise #6 Positioning - Gradient underlines

Realize a gradient underline, centered below the text, taking 50% width of its parent container.

This time we apply pseudo elements together with positioning.

The gradient border should start at the exact bottom of the element (use "top" for placement). Use two other positioning properties for centering the element below the text.
