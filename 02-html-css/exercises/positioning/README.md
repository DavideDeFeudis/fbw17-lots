# Positioning exercises

The exercises 1-5 cover the positioning properties:

- relative
- absolute
- fixed
- sticky

The z-index is covered in exercise 10 and onward.

## Prerequisites

### Pseudo elements

The exercises 6-9 train the usage of pseudo elements together with positioning to add stylistic elements to boxes.

The exercises 11-13 train some real life scenarios on positioning & pseudo elements.

So it is a prerequisite that students know about pseudo elements ::before and ::after before doing these.
