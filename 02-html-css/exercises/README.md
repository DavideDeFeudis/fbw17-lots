## Notes / prerequisites for exercise usage

### Images

In most exercises that deal with some kind of image you will find that often "unsplash.it" is used as a service to grab random images of any size. The service is free to use.

In case you want to use the related exercises you either have to introduce unsplash.it to the students or replace all references to it by your own "handmade" choice of images. Feel free :-)
