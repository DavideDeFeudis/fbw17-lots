# Exercise #3 - Text on images - The blur-filter

In our file index.html we have a setup of two cards.


Each card should get a random background image. But this time we want to apply the technqiue to place the background image inside a pseudo element and attach the pseudo element to its container. 

This way we have the most control on the image and can, e.g., apply filters easily.  

- The left image should have no filter applied on the background image (just stays as it is)
- The right image should get a slightly blurred background on hover to increase readability of the text. Use the CSS filter property for that 

We want to show some text on top of the cards. Try to setup the z-index so the text either goes on top of the background pseudo element or set the background pseudo to go behind the text.

See the concrete instrunctions in the file index.html.

Too bored with the exercise? Then try to write all CSS on your own. Use the file index-no-css.html in this case. 

At the end you can compare the left image text with the right image text. Compare the readability.

Good luck!
