# Exercise #4 - Text on images - The color-filter on hover

In our file index.html we have a setup of two cards.

Each card should get a random image placed on top of a black background.

We want to show some text on top of everything. 

The left image without opacity on the background image.
The right one should get opacity (applying a color filter) to increase readability of the text.

Instructions:

- Use absolute positioning to place a random unsplash image within the card
- When hovering over a card:
  - Show the card title
  - Show a box around the title by using a pseudo-element (=> use absolute position again to place it like in the result below)
- When hovering over image 2:
  - Please make the image transparent a bit against it's back background. Apply opacity for that. So the text becomes much more readable

At the end you can compare the left image text with the right image text. Compare the readability.

Endresult:

Good luck!
