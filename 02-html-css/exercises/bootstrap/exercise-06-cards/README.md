# Bootstrap - Exercise #6 - Cards collection

Now we apply the grid system together with UI components.

Cards Task: Make 6 cards with buttons as shown in the image below.

By default they should be stacked on top of one another.

On medium devices (>= 768px) three columns should flow next to each other like seen below.

Just use ONE div with the class "row".
