# SCSS Bootstrap Customization Exercise #2

Now let's change some values of bootstrap:

In the file custom.scss put the following at the top:

```
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": purple,
  "danger": salmon
);
```

Now transpile your custom.scss to css again.

Take a look at your web-page (reload if necessary):
Now the button colors for primary and danger should have changed.
