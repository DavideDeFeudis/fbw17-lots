# Emmet Exercise #1 - Exploration

Use the series of the following emmet statements to create an HTML page. Each instruction line should be realized with one line of emmet code.

- File index.html: Create an HTML boilerplate using the exclamation mark (!)
- Create an h1 tag with content "Emmet"
- Create a div with the class "container"
- Within container: Create two sections with the ids "secOne" and "secTwo" (use "+" to create the second section as a sibling)
- Within section 1:
  - Create a paragraph tag with one lorem paragraph
  - Create another paragraph tag with 5 lorem words
- Withing section 2:
  - Create an ul with 3 li child items. Each li should have an ID (use "item$" to create a unique id for each one). And each list item should have an incrementing number as content (1-3) (=> use "{$}" for that).   
- Create a footer with two child span items. The first span should get 1 lorem word as content. The second span should get the content "This is the end". Use parentheses () to group the two item declarations
