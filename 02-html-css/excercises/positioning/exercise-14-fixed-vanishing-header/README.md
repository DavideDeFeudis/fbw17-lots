# Exercise 14 - Positioning + fixed background images

In this exercise we have a webpage with the following stack:

NAVBAR
HEADER
CONTENT

We want that our navbar keeps always on the top when scrolling.
The header background image should get fixed when scrolling. So does the header title. 

When we scroll, the content should go on top of the header, so we see an effect of the header slowly getting "eaten up".

Try to apply the following properties to solve the exercise: 
position: sticky, position: fixed and background-attachment: fixed
