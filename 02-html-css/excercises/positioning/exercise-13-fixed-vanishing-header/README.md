# Exercise 13 - Positioning + fixed background images

In the following exercise we have a nav, a header image and a content area.

Try to style the header image + the text on top so it behaves like this on scrolling:

We want that our navbar keeps always on the top when scrolling.
The header background image should get fixed when scrolling. So does the header title.

When we scroll, the content should go on top of the header, so we see an effect of the header slowly getting "eaten up".

Try to apply the following properties to solve the exercise:
position: sticky, position: fixed and background-attachment: fixed
